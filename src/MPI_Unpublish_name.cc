  Currently, LAM/MPI ignores any info keys that are passed to this function.\n\
  As such, info keys specific to a different implementation can safely be\n\
  passed to this function. Additionally, the MPI constant MPI_INFO_NULL can\n\
  also be used.\n\
\n\
  The scope of the published name is the LAM universe -- MPI processes\n\
  running on any node included from the initial lamboot are capable of\n\
  retrieving a name published by MPI_Publish_name. Service names stay in\n\
  existence until they are either manually removed with MPI_Unpublish_name\n\
  or cleaned with the lamclean command. It is a common mistake to forget\n\
  to MPI_Unpublish_name at the end of a run, and therefore leave published\n\
  names in the LAM runtime environment.\n\
