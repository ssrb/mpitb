* Mandelbrot demo *
*******************

Classical example of parallel computation & display of the Mandelbrot set.
Several solutions are explored, with varied performance results:
- Striped: each node computes a vertical stripe of the complex area considered
	that's probably the solution used in the below mentioned TechRep
	carefully choosing limits you might be able to reproduce their results
- TaskBag: a master casts line indexes, slaves compute & send result back
	in a first version, master also works if no slave sends results
		problem: there is some granularity in response to slaves
	in a second version, master computer runs 2 processes (MPI ranks)
		one is the master who casts, the other is a normal slave
		OS does a very good job switching among them
- Strided: taking advantage of programmer's knowledge about the problem
	almost linear speedup, efficiency slooooowly degrading with #nodes

* Suggestions *
***************

You might:
- see comments in mandelbrot.m to learn howto run it from command line
- run it (sequential program, be it from command line or interactively)

- see timing.pdf to build an opinion on the different parallel versions
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names
- run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out

- see comments in mandelStrp.m to learn howto run it from command line
- try them out: mandelStrp, mandelTBag, mandelStrd
- notice how much better is mandelStrd

- for advanced users: study the timingXXXX scripts and run them
- (you probably don't want to oversubscribe nodes unless they're biprocs)
- (like the ones used for timing.pdf)
- compare your results to timing.pdf
- notice the different mpirun syntax used for mandelTBg2 (node0 master & slave)
