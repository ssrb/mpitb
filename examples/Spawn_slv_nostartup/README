**************
* Spawn demo * the slaves-without-startup-control variant
**************

Just a couple of examples to help prospective users to understand
howto MPI_Comm_spawn can be used to launch (from Octave) other binaries
such as xterms or even additional octaves...

...and help them understand that those are running in _other_ computers :-)

Introduces to:
	MPI command	MPI_Comm_spawn
	MPITB utility	LAM_Init
	MPITB utility	LAM_Clean
	MPITB startup	startup_MPITB

Notice that the startup_MPITB.m file has the normal, empty else branch
in the final "if isempty(geten('LAMPARENT')) ... else ... end"
That's what we mean by without-startup-control. The slave octaves
will just run the commands prescribed in their spawn command-line
(hopefully one of them is MPI_Init)


************
* Contents *
************

- Spawn_xterms.m	Demo for launching slave xterms
- Spawn_octaves.m	Demo for launching slave octaves
- startup_MPITB.m	MPITB .octaverc startup file

- lam-bhost.def		default bhost file to be used by lamboot
- MPI_Init		link to stdlone program to ./MPI_Init from slv xterms
- MPI_Init.c		corresponding source file

- README		This file

***************
* Suggestions *
***************

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names
- run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out
- make sure the lamd process in cluster nodes has inherited a working $DISPLAY
	(that might be tricky and require local sysadmin advice) (*)
- run octave
- try Spawn_xterms(2) and Spawn_octaves(2)
- play with Spawn_octaves(2,'ls') to see how all is blocked until MPI_Init

* DISCLAIMER *

Sorry if it doesn't work. Either ask for local help, or give up :-)

Do notice that:
- mpirun'nable demos were designed because most users get stalled at (*)
	we are no longer recommending users to MPI_Comm_spawn at all
- debugging your remote cluster configuration from here is a very hard task
- just due to your not understanding why it gets blocked, that's why
	you won't be able to provide useful information for us to debug it
- if your cluster is so configured, it's because your sysadmin wants it so:
	paranoid iptables settings, localhost names in DISPLAY, etc
