Classical "Hello, World!" snippet.

This is by and far the easiest MPITB demo we have been able to think of.
It introduces 4 of the "basic 6" MPI routines:
- MPI_Init	you should not use any MPI routine before this one
		(except perhaps MPI_Wtick/_Wtime)
- MPI_Finalize	you must finish with MPI before exiting from your program

- MPI_Send/Recv	not used here - really really simple example

- MPI_Comm_size	size of the communicator. That is,
		number of MPI processes started together via mpirun
		All them are collectively referred to as "MPI_COMM_WORLD",
		the default communicator
- MPI_Comm_rank	"order" or "number" of the process in the communicator
		starting out from 0, ie, "mpirun -c 2 octave -q --eval hello"
		launches a world of size 2 comprising ranks 0 & 1

- Hello.m		Hello world MPITB version
- startup_MPITB.m	MPITB .octaverc startup file

- lam-bhost.def		default bhost file to be used by lamboot
			...can also be used as Open-MPI hostfile
- README		This file

- .Hello_2_1_73.m	corresponding app&startup files from 2.1.73 version,
- .s2.1.73_MPITB.m	both hidden

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names
- for  LAM/MPI: run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out
- for Open-MPI: bhost can be used with the rsh/ssh starter (-hostfile switch)

- see comments in Hello.m to learn howto run it from command line
- BTW, study it all since this README is longer than the code
- try it out: you should obtain something similar to amber's messages above
- for instance, from command line:
    mpirun -c 2				octave -q --eval Hello	# for LAM
    mpirun -c 2 -H h1,h2		octave -q --eval Hello	# for Open-MPI
    mpirun -c 2 -hostfile lam-bhost.def octave -q --eval Hello	# OMPI/hostfile

- proceed on to more difficult examples: Pi, PingPong, NPB/EP, Mandelbrot...
