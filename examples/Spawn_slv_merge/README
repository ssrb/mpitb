**************
* Spawn demo * the slaves-mergeParent variant
**************

Just a couple of examples to help prospective users to understand
howto MPI_Comm_spawn/Octave_spawn can be used to launch (from Octave)
additional slave octave processes, even make them run arbitrary commands...

...and help them understand that those are running in _other_ computers :-)

Uses the previously introduced (in Spawn_slv_nostartup):
	MPI command	MPI_Comm_spawn
	MPITB utility	LAM_Init
	MPITB utility	LAM_Clean
	MPITB startup	startup_MPITB
Introduces to:
	MPITB startup	startup_mergeParent
	MPI command	MPI_Intercomm_merge
	MPITB utility	Octave_spawn
	MPI command	MPI_Bcast, _Send, _Recv

Notice that the startup_MPITB.m file has 1 uncommented line in the else
branch in the final "if isempty(geten('LAMPARENT')) ... else ... end"
The line is "startup_mergeParent", thus the variant name. The slave octaves
might be instructed to perform any arbitrarily long series of commands
in the mentioned slave startup script (read it in the startups subdir).

startup_mergeParent basically performs MPI_Init and MPI_Intercomm_merge.


************
* Contents *
************

- Spawn_oct_man.m	Demo for manually spawning and merging slave octaves
- Spawn_oct_auto.m	Same demo, using automated script Octave_Spawn
- Spawn_oct_bcast.m	Similar demo, adding cmd-bcast-eval and w/out LAM_Clean
- startup_MPITB.m	MPITB .octaverc startup file

- lam-bhost.def		default bhost file to be used by lamboot

- README		This file

***************
* Suggestions *
***************

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names, or...
- ...alternatively, edit HOSTS cell in these Spawn* M-files or in LAM_Init
- run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out (or let LAM_Init do the job)
- make sure the lamd process in cluster nodes has inherited a working $DISPLAY
	(that might be tricky and require local sysadmin advice) (*)
- run octave
- try Spawn_oct_man(2), Spawn_oct_auto, and Spawn_oct_bcast(3)
- play with octaves launched from Spawn_oct_bcast (it does not LAM_Clean)

* DISCLAIMER *
**************

Sorry if it doesn't work. Either ask for local help, or give up :-)

Do notice that:
- mpirun'nable demos were designed because most users get stalled at (*)
	we are no longer recommending users to MPI_Comm_spawn at all
- debugging your remote cluster configuration from here is a very hard task
- just due to your not understanding why it gets blocked, that's why
	you won't be able to provide useful information for us to debug it
- if your cluster is so configured, it's because your sysadmin wants it so:
	paranoid iptables settings, localhost names in DISPLAY, etc
