NAS Parallel Benchmarks' Embarrassingly Parallel (EP) demo

A wealth of random numbers are generated using a linear congruential
generator. This can be trivially parallelized with the powers trick:
it lets us deduce which will be the 2^N random number starting out
from a given seed. So we can compute the starting point for several
slaves (as if the sequence started by the master was continued by
slave 1 after 2^N randoms, and by slave 2 after another 2^N randoms,
and so on), and let each of them produce 2^N randoms.

The compound sequence (if it was effectively joined by concatenating
master and slaves sequences) is expected to be identical to sequential.
Correctness is verified converting randoms to pairs (points in the
plane) and tallying how many of them fall into square annuli of
increasing size. Tally counters are reduced in the master and compared
to a precompiled validation list.

* Suggestions *
***************

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names
- for  LAM/MPI: run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out
- for Open-MPI: bhost can be used with the rsh/ssh starter (-hostfile switch)

- see comments in ep.m to learn howto run it from command line
- try it out: beware that classes above 'S' require long runtimes

- see the results obtained by us (*.sxc, *.pdf) using the ep.sh script
- optionally, study and run the script:  ./ep8.sh
