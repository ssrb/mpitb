**************
* Spawn demo * the slaves-eval variant
**************

Just the second example of all the other Spawn demos, but setting the
particular startup protocol using the --eval octave switch in spawn,
instead of fixing it with the else branch in the master startup file.

This way, several applications with different protocols can live in
the same subdir. If protocol was fixed in the master startup file,
it would force all apps in the same subdir to the same protocol.

Re-uses the second demo of each subdir:
Spawn_slv_nostartup:	Spawn_octaves	pristine in fact, it's just a link
Spawn_slv_merge:	Spawn_oct_auto
Spawn_slv_bcast:	Spawn_staggrd	recall required startup_bcastSlv modif
Spawn_slv_ncmds:	Spawn_auto	recall required lena.mat

The only differences are:
	MPITB startup	startup_MPITB	has now an empty else branch
	MPITB utility	Octave_spawn	uses --eval to choose slave startup

* Suggestions *
***************

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names, or...
- ...alternatively, edit HOSTS cell in these Spawn* M-files or in LAM_Init
- run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out (or let LAM_Init do the job)
- make sure the lamd process in cluster nodes has inherited a working $DISPLAY
	(that might be tricky and require local sysadmin advice) (*)
- run octave
- try Spawn_octaves, Spawn_oct_auto, Spawn_staggrd, Spawn_auto


**************
* DISCLAIMER *
**************

Sorry if it doesn't work. Either ask for local help, or give up :-)

Do notice that:
- mpirun'nable demos were designed because most users get stalled at (*)
	we are no longer recommending users to MPI_Comm_spawn at all
- debugging your remote cluster configuration from here is a very hard task
- just due to your not understanding why it gets blocked, that's why
	you won't be able to provide useful information for us to debug it
- if your cluster is so configured, it's because your sysadmin wants it so:
	paranoid iptables settings, localhost names in DISPLAY, etc
