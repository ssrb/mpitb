# -------------------------------------
# For multi-node LAM, localhost is not a valid hostname.
# Edit below to reflect your LAM node-names
# mpirun will use them round-robin by default
# See man bhost(5) for additional information
# -------------------------------------
# For using utilities in MPITB_HOME/utils such as LAM_Init
# an appropriately reversed list (master node last in list)
# should be provided, so spawned processes won't
# oversubscribe master node where the interactive Octave
# is running
