**************
* Spawn demo * the slaves-broadcast variant
**************

Just a couple of examples to help prospective users to understand
howto use Octave_spawn to launch (from within this Octave) additional
slave octave processes, and howto make them run arbitrary commands,
which are decided at runtime and broadcast to all them...

...and help them understand that those are running in _other_ computers :-)

Uses the previously introduced (in Spawn_slv_nostartup):
	MPITB utility	LAM_Init
	MPITB utility	MPITB_Clean
	MPITB startup	startup_MPITB
Uses the previously introduced (in Spawn_slv_merge):
	MPITB utility	Octave_spawn
	MPI command	MPI_Bcast
Introduces to:
	MPITB startup	startup_bcastSlv

Notice that the startup_MPITB.m file has 1 uncommented line in the else
branch in the final "if isempty(geten('LAMPARENT')) ... else ... end"
The line is "startup_bcastSlv", thus the variant name. The slave octaves
might be instructed to perform any arbitrarily long series of commands
in the mentioned slave startup script (read it in the startups subdir).

startup_bcastSlv basically performs MPI_Init and MPI_Intercomm_merge
(just like the previously studied startup_mergeParent) and additionally
MPI_Bcast(cmd) and eval(cmd). The MPI_Finalize and quit commands
have been removed in this local version of startup_bcastSlv.


************
* Contents *
************

- Spawn_bcast.m		Demo using MPI_Bcast the normal way
- Spawn_staggrd.m	Difficult staggering exercise solved using bcast proto
- startup_MPITB.m	MPITB .octaverc startup file
- startup_bcastSlv.m	MPITB slave-bc  startup file modified so as not to quit

- lam-bhost.def		default bhost file to be used by lamboot

- README		This file

***************
* Suggestions *
***************

You could:
- edit lam-bhost.def to reflect your cluster node names, or...
- ...alternatively, edit HOSTS cell in these Spawn* M-files or in LAM_Init
- run lamboot / lamnodes to start LAM out (or let LAM_Init do the job)
- make sure the lamd process in cluster nodes has inherited a working $DISPLAY
	(that might be tricky and require local sysadmin advice) (*)
- run octave
- try Spawn_bcast(2) and Spawn_staggrd(3)

* DISCLAIMER *
**************

Sorry if it doesn't work. Either ask for local help, or give up :-)

Do notice that:
- mpirun'nable demos were designed because most users get stalled at (*)
	we are no longer recommending users to MPI_Comm_spawn at all
- debugging your remote cluster configuration from here is a very hard task
- just due to your not understanding why it gets blocked, that's why
	you won't be able to provide useful information for us to debug it
- if your cluster is so configured, it's because your sysadmin wants it so:
	paranoid iptables settings, localhost names in DISPLAY, etc
